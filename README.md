# Windmill
- This is my college project on Computer Graphics. <br>
- Here we implemented a windmill using GLUT library in CPP.
# Pre-Requisite
- Firstly you have GLUT library in your local machine. <br>
- For this, you can search videos on youtube How to set GLUT library in visual studio code or Dev C++ compiler.
# How to run
- You can run directly on Dev C++. <br>
- For visual studio, first compile the program by running following command- <br>
"g++ windmill.cpp -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o windmill" <br>
then run ".windmill"
